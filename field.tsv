Nature 590, 290-299 (2021) ~Ehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03205-y~ <br> <br>After phasing the UK Biobank genetic data (carried out on 81 chromosomal chunks using Eagle v.2.4), the phased data were converted from GRCh37 to GRCh38 using LiftOver. Imputation was performed using Minimac4 v1.0.2 (~Ehttps://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac4~). The reference panel is the TOPMed R2 panel, which is available to public at ~Ehttps://imputation.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov~. Imputation was performed in 1Mb chunks and merged back together by chromosome. Due to large data size, markers with poor imputation were not retained (excluded Minimac4 imputation quality metric R^2 < 0.1). Across all the chromosomes, 677,037 markers were used for imputation. <br>For distribution to UK Biobank, output Minimac4 VCF files were converted to BGEN format using qctool v2.0.8. The conversion used the Genotype Probability (GP) field from source VCF and the probabilities are stored using 8 bit precision. <br> <br>Details on contributing cohorts for the TOPMed Imputataion Panel can be seen in Extended Table 3 of Sequencing of 53,831 diverse genomes from the NHLBI TOPMed Program.

22000	Genotype measurement batch	0	2	0	21	11	0	0	0	0	0		100313	22000	0	0	0	0	0	Genotyping was done using two closely related arrays, referred to as the UK BiLEVE array and the UK Biobank Axiom array. The BiLEVE array was designed first and run on ~50,000 participants. The UKB Axiom array was designed subsequently with a view to maximizing marker overlap as much as possible between the arrays and run on the remaining ~450,000 participants. The UKB Axiom array had over 820,000 SNPs and indel markers, and the UK BiLEVE array was very similar with over 95% common content. <p> Samples were analysed in batches of approximately 4700 items. Interim results from first 33 batches (UKBiLEVE_b1-11 and Batch_b001-022) were released 18 months ahead of the remainder. The CEL files from these interim batches were subsequently re-analysed as part of the QC process for the full release, and this resulted in minor changes to the associated calls.	2014-07-28T00:00:00	2017-04-26T00:00:00	487921	487921	100	0	1	2

We recommend the use of these measurements to allow comparison to other studies where Z-standardised measures are available Full details of these measures and adjustments can be found in Codd, V. et al (~Ehttps://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.21253457~), and exemplar use of the measurements, including a GWAS, can be found in Codd, V. et al (~Ehttps://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.21253516~.)	2020-08-21T00:00:00	2021-01-22T00:00:00	473751	473753	0	0	1	2

22194	T/S ratio for regression dilution bias	0	0	0	31	0	0	3	1	0	0		265	0	2	0	2	0	0	To gain an estimate of within-individual variation in leucocyte telomere length, paired measurements were made for 1351 UK Biobank participants for whom two separate DNA samples were available (taken at a mean difference of 5.5 years apart). These samples were taken from the baseline visit and one follow-up visit. As these measurements were performed in pairs (under the same technical conditions and parameters), no further technical adjustments were necessary. These measurements may not correspond to those for the same individuals within the main datasets (~F22190~, ~F22191~, ~F22192~) due to re-plating and re-measurement of the sample to produce the paired measurements for this specific analysis. For this reason, these data should be used independently of the main datasets and not in combination. Full details of this experiment can be found in Codd, V. et al (~Ehttps://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.21253457~), and exemplar use of the derived regression dilution ratio can be found in Codd V et al (~Ehttps://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.21253516~).<br><br> <b>Researchers wishing to correct for regression dilution bias should use a correction factor of 0.65 for ~F22191~ and a correction factor of 0.68 for ~F22192~.</b>	2021-01-17T00:00:00	2021-01-22T00:00:00	1351	2702	0	0	1	2

In addition, we have identified a number of dates that have been incorrectly processed in the construction of data-field 22700 and which are up to 30 months different from the participant's change of address notification. We are working to correct this issue and will update the data-field in due course.	2017-01-06T00:00:00	2020-03-13T00:00:00	502137	774288	0	0	1	1

Atrial volume calculations required Python libraries to extract segmentation boundaries, approximately evaluating a 3D volume by assuming an ellipsoid object. An upgrade to these libraries introduced some numerical differences in a small subset of participants. Where multiple values were provided, the most recent version of the segmentation has been retained. <p> Array 0: Data derived in 2020 and published in ~Ehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1009-y~. <p> Array 1: Data derived in 2021 after update of Python libraries.	2023-05-11T00:00:00	2023-05-11T00:00:00	39683	40630	0	0	1	1

26410	Index of Multiple Deprivation (England)	0	0	0	31	0	0	3	0	0	0		76	0	0	0	0	0	0	The English Indices of Deprivation 2010 are measures of multiple deprivation at the small area level. The model of multiple deprivation which underpins the Indices of Deprivation 2010 is based on the idea of distinct domains of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These domains are experienced by individuals living in an area. People may be counted in one or more of the domains, depending on the number of types of deprivation that they experience.<p> Each domain represents a specific form of deprivation experienced by people and each can be measured individually using a number of indicators. Seven distinct domains have been identified in the English Indices of Deprivation; Income Deprivation, Employment Deprivation, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education Skills and Training Deprivation, Barriers to Housing and Services, Living Environment Deprivation, and Crime. Individual domains can be used in isolation as measures of each specific form of deprivation. They can also be combined, using appropriate weights, into a single overall Index of Multiple Deprivation which can be used to rank every small area in England according to the deprivation experienced by the people living there. Along with two supplementary indices, Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index and Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index, they form the English Indices of Deprivation. These statistics allow the most, and least, deprived areas of the country to be identified as well as providing information about the issues faced by people living in different parts of the country.	2018-05-02T00:00:00	2018-05-04T00:00:00	432406	432406	0	0	1	1

26424	Physical environment score (Wales)	0	0	0	31	0	0	3	0	0	0		76	0	0	0	0	0	0	The purpose of this domain is to measure environmental factors that may impact on quality of life in an area. Negative impacts on quality of life are judged to be a form of deprivation. Environmental deprivation is generally not correlated with social or economic deprivation in Wales. (ref: Walker et al 2003). This domain does not capture aspects of deprivation such as health inequalities (this is an objective of the Health domain). Data covering Wales is not available on actual impacts on quality of life; so factors were chosen that were judged to indicate an increased potential for reduced quality of life and had data available. The indicators used for the physical environment domain were: <ul> <li>Air Quality</li> <li>Air Emissions</li> <li>Flood risk</li> <li>Proximity to waste disposal and industrial sites</li> </ul>	2018-05-02T00:00:00	2018-05-04T00:00:00	21181	21181	0	0	1	1

26426	Index of Multiple Deprivation (Wales)	0	0	0	31	0	0	3	0	0	0		76	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2008 is the official measure of deprivation for small areas in Wales. It was developed for the Welsh Assembly Government by the Assembly's Statistical Directorate and the Local Government Data Unit (Wales). <p> The WIMD 2008 is made up of eight separate domains (or kinds) of deprivation: income, employment, health, education, housing, environment, access to services, and community safety. <p> Each of them was based on a range of different indicators which meant that they were measured in different ways using different units. So before they could be combined the measurements had to be transformed to make them compatible. For example, if the height of something had been measured in metres and the weight in kilograms it would not make sense simply to add them together. <p> Income and employment were classed as the most important factors, and they were given the biggest weighting in the overall index. Although there is more to deprivation than poverty, not having enough money or a job is a big part of it.	2018-05-02T00:00:00	2018-05-04T00:00:00	21181	21181	0	0	1	1
26427	Index of Multiple Deprivation (Scotland)	0	0	0	31	0	0	3	0	0	0		76	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2009 identifies small area concentrations of multiple deprivation across Scotland in a consistent manner. The SIMD combines data from seven distinct domains or topic areas all of which are considered to be important contributors to deprivation levels. These domains have remained the same as in the previous version of the index, published in 2006, and the data used in compiling each one is the most appropriate and up to date that was available at the time of constructing the index. <p> The SIMD is a relative measure of deprivation that uses 6,505 data zones across Scotland as its unit of comparison. The rank applied to each of these data zones identifies each as being more or less deprived than all the others in the country. The rankings run from 1 being the most deprived to 6505 being the least deprived. Therefore the smaller the ranking the more deprived the data zone. As the SIMD is a relative measure it cannot show how much more deprived one data zone is than another, e.g. that a data zone ranked 5 is twice as deprived as a data zone ranked 10. In the same way the distance between each ranking can vary - so the gap between the data zones ranked 16 and 17 could be very small while the gap between those ranked 17 and 18 could be much bigger. <p> The SIMD can be used to identify the small areas with the highest concentrations of multiple deprivation in Scotland using either the overall index or the individual domains. The most commonly used cut off levels are 10%, 15% or 20% - although different cut offs may be required depending on individual policy or organisational focus.	2018-05-02T00:00:00	2018-07-06T00:00:00	35838	35838	0	0	1	1

90004	Acceleration intensity time-series	0	0	0	41	0	20	3	0	0	0		1008	0	0	0	0	0	0	These time-series files describe a participant's accelerometer measured physical activity intensity every five seconds. Each measurement represents the average vector magnitude across all samples recorded in each five second epoch/period. This file may be useful for those interested in analysing accelerometer measured physical activity by time. <p> The first column contains the acceleration value where the units of measurement are milli-gravity. The second column indicates whether this is an actual measurement (value = <blank>) or imputed (value = 1). The time associated with each reading can be inferred from the very first row, which describes the start and end times of the data. Each successive reading is incremented by five seconds. <p> For example, <br>"acceleration (mg) - 2014-05-07 13:29:50 - 2014-05-13 09:50:25 - sampleRate = 5 seconds, imputed" <br>indicates that the first measurement time is at 2014-05-07 13:29:50, the second at 2014-05-07 13:29:55, the third at 2014-05-07 13:30:00 ... and the last at 2014-05-13 09:50:25. <p> Files are typically 760KB each in the raw state and usually compress to around 170KB.	2016-03-02T00:00:00	2016-04-19T00:00:00	103617	103617	110	0	1	2

A serving is about the amount that would be dished up using a serving spoon (large spoon typically used in canteens or self-service buffets). Example: a beef stew with carrot and parsnip may have enough vegetables in it to count as a half serving of carrots plus a half serving of parsnip (possibly even a whole serving if there are a lot of vegetables in the stew). If not, it may be better to record the vegetables as a half serving of Vegetable pieces. For a selection of vegetables where the precise type may be unknown (for example in a shop bought vegetable pie or a stir fry cooked by a friend) please guess the total amount and record that under Vegetable pieces. Olives should have been recorded earlier under 'Savoury Snacks'.

Hence in the face of overall scan time pressure, the T2/PD scan was dropped from the protocol during the pilot.	2023-05-26T00:00:00	2015-05-08T00:00:00	-1	-1	140	0	2	3
